# Command line: callpeak -f BAMPE -g hs --keep-dup all --cutoff-analysis -n S4 -t S4.filtered.shifted.bam --outdir macs2/S4
# ARGUMENTS LIST:
# name = S4
# format = BAMPE
# ChIP-seq file = ['S4.filtered.shifted.bam']
# control file = None
# effective genome size = 2.70e+09
# band width = 300
# model fold = [5, 50]
# qvalue cutoff = 5.00e-02
# The maximum gap between significant sites is assigned as the read length/tag size.
# The minimum length of peaks is assigned as the predicted fragment length "d".
# Larger dataset will be scaled towards smaller dataset.
# Range for calculating regional lambda is: 10000 bps
# Broad region calling is off
# Paired-End mode is on
